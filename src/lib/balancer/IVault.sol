    /**
     * @dev Called by users to join a Pool, which transfers tokens from `sender` into the Pool's balance. This will
     * trigger custom Pool behavior, which will typically grant something in return to `recipient` - often tokenized
     * Pool shares.
     *
     * If the caller is not `sender`, it must be an authorized relayer for them.
     *
     * The `assets` and `maxAmountsIn` arrays must have the same length, and each entry indicates the maximum amount
     * to send for each asset. The amounts to send are decided by the Pool and not the Vault: it just enforces
     * these maximums.
     *
     * If joining a Pool that holds WETH, it is possible to send ETH directly: the Vault will do the wrapping. To enable
     * this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be passed in the `assets` array instead of the
     * WETH address. Note that it is not possible to combine ETH and WETH in the same join. Any excess ETH will be sent
     * back to the caller (not the sender, which is important for relayers).
     *
     * `assets` must have the same length and order as the array returned by `getPoolTokens`. This prevents issues when
     * interacting with Pools that register and deregister tokens frequently. If sending ETH however, the array must be
     * sorted *before* replacing the WETH address with the ETH sentinel value (the zero address), which means the final
     * `assets` array might not be sorted. Pools with no registered tokens cannot be joined.
     *
     * If `fromInternalBalance` is true, the caller's Internal Balance will be preferred: ERC20 transfers will only
     * be made for the difference between the requested amount and Internal Balance (if any). Note that ETH cannot be
     * withdrawn from Internal Balance: attempting to do so will trigger a revert.
     *
     * This causes the Vault to call the `IBasePool.onJoinPool` hook on the Pool's contract, where Pools implement
     * their own custom logic. This typically requires additional information from the user (such as the expected number
     * of Pool shares). This can be encoded in the `userData` argument, which is ignored by the Vault and passed
     * directly to the Pool's contract, as is `recipient`.
     *
     * Emits a `PoolBalanceChanged` event.
